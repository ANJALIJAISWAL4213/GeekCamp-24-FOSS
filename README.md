This task comprises the following steps.

### Step 1

- Write the name of your roommate on the first line of the file.
- Commit these changes.

### Step 2

- Create a new branch named `feature` (and switch to it) from the `Task-2` branch.
- Specify two habits of your roommate that annoy you on **lines 2 and 3** of the file.
- Commit these changes.

### Step 3

- Return to the `Task-2` branch.
- Write 2-3 sentences something good about your roommate, just below their name, i.e., on lines 2 and 3.
- Commit these changes.

### Final step

- Merge the changes from the `feature` branch into the `Task-2` branch.

*Upon completing this task, ensure you have precisely 4 commits, and the data entered in both steps 2 & 3 persists in the file. Push these changes and create a PR. Remember to mention the Issue No. in the PR.*
