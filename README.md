# Final BOSS: FOSS⚔️

## Task 3

### Step 1

- Start by switching to the `Task-3` branch.
- Create a new file named `github-username.py`. For instance, if your GitHub username is **sarthakvermaa**, the file name should be `sarthakvermaa.py`.
- Answer the following four questions in the new file, each answer committed separately with the commit message `Commit <Question No.>`:

  - **Ques1-** What is your favorite TV Show/Web Series?
  - **Ques2-** Why do you like the show/series?
  - **Ques3-** Name your crush (could be from outside the college too).
    Now, let's get serious.
  - **Ques4-** Suppose I created an empty folder in my local repository. Can I add and commit this change? Answer with a Y/N.

- You should have 4 commits in your branch now. Push these changes to the `Task-3` branch and create a PR. Make sure to mention the `Issue No.` in the PR.

### Step 2

- I've had a change of heart.
- Return to your local system and delete the last 2 commits.
- Push these changes as well.

### Step 3

- Answer this final question. **Ques5-** What was your experience during the FOSS Workshops?
- Save these changes but do not commit them. Store them away using git.

### Final Step

- Once again, I've changed my mind ;). Alter the commit message of the last commit in your branch to `Commit Message changed successfully`.
- Lastly, retrieve the changes you had stored away and commit them with the message `Task 3 Completed`.
- Push all these changes, and your task will conclude.
